# Read Me First

> Welcome to an alternative blog setup for Notion users. This application provides full control over your content with MDX files for Markdown.

## How to Use It?

1. The pages folder contains all the MDX files, and you must add your Markdown files to this folder.
2. index.mdx serves as the main endpoint.
3. The blog folder is where you can write and organize your blog posts.
4. To define a new route, add a new folder within the pages directory, such as contact/index.mdx.
5. Each MDX file must follow the frontmatter format (metadata) used in other existing files.
6. You can add support components inside MDX files.

## What Are the Components in MDX Files?

These are built-in components available in the MDX compiler for easy integration. Hereâ€™s the list:

```tsx
import Articles from './components/articles/articles';
import Banner from './components/banner/banner';
import BlogLatest from './components/blog/latest';
import CategoryList from './components/category/category-list';
import InFooter from './components/footer/in-footer';
import Navbar from './components/navbar/navbar';
```
