Google Analytics is a powerful tool that provides insights into your website’s traffic, user behavior, and performance. Integrating Google Analytics into a Next.js application allows you to track page views, user interactions, and other critical metrics to optimize your site.

With Next.js 14, there’s an easier way to integrate Google Analytics via the @next/third-parties/google package, streamlining the setup process.

In this guide, we will walk through how to set up Google Analytics in a Next.js application using the `@next/third-parties/google` package.

## **Prerequisites**

1. **Next.js 14+** installed in your project.
2. A **Google Analytics account**.
3. Your **Google Analytics Tracking ID** (for example, G-XXXXXXXXXX).

### **Step 1: Install @next/third-parties/google**

To get started, install the @next/third-parties/google package by running the following command in your Next.js project:

```bash
npm install @next/third-parties/google
```

This package is designed to integrate third-party tools like Google Analytics more easily into a Next.js app.

### **Step 2: Get Your Google Analytics Tracking ID**

Before configuring Google Analytics, ensure you have your **Tracking ID** (also known as a Measurement ID in **GA4**). You can get it from the **Google Analytics Dashboard** under Admin > Property Settings.

Your Tracking ID will look something like this: **G-XXXXXXXXXX.**

### **Step 3: Create a Google Analytics Component:**

To streamline the integration, create a reusable Google Analytics component.

1. Create a folder called `components/google-analytics`.
2. Inside that folder, create a file called `GoogleAnalytics.tsx`.

Here’s the code for the component:

```jsx
import { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google';

export default GoogleAnalytics;
```

### **Step4: Add Your Google Analytics Key to Environment Variables:**

Add your Google Analytics Tracking ID to your Next.js environment variables.

1. Create or update your `.env.local` file at the root of your project.
2. Add your Google Analytics Tracking ID:

```jsx
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=<key>
```

This ensures the Tracking ID is securely accessed within your application and can be change in the future.

### Step 5: **Integrate Google Analytics into Your Next.js Application**

Now, integrate Google Analytics into your application by adding the GoogleAnalytics component to your layout file.

In the app/layout.tsx file, add the following code:

```java
...
<body>
{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID && (
  <GoogleAnalytics gaId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID} />
)}
</body>
...
```

This will initialize Google Analytics whenever the layout is rendered.

### Step 6: **Tracking Custom Events:**

You can track custom events, such as button clicks, with Google Analytics. For example, to track when a user clicks the “Add to Cart” button, you can use the sendGAEvent function from the @next/third-parties/google package.

Here’s how to set it up:

```java
'use client';

import { sendGAEvent } from '@next/third-parties/google';

export function AddToCartButton({ seoURL }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          // Perform your application-specific logic here.

          // Send the click event to Google Analytics.
          sendGAEvent('event', 'buttonClicked', { value: seoURL });
        }}
      >
        Add to cart
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the sendGAEvent function logs the button click to Google Analytics.

### **Step 7: Testing Google Analytics**

To make sure Google Analytics is set up correctly:

1. **Deploy your Next.js app** or run it locally with npm run dev.
2. Open your site and navigate through various pages.
3. In the **Google Analytics Real-Time dashboard**, you should see your own activity reflected in real-time.

This confirms that Google Analytics is properly tracking your site’s traffic and interactions.

### **Conclusion**

Integrating Google Analytics into your **Next.js** application with the `@next/third-parties/google` package makes it easy to track page views and custom events. This powerful integration gives you the data you need to improve your site’s performance and user experience.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can quickly set up Google Analytics to monitor user activity and track important interactions on your Next.js application.
