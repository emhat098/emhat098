Deploying an Express.js application to Vercel is a straightforward process that allows you to get your application live quickly. In this article, we’ll walk through the steps required to deploy a simple Express.js application to Vercel.

### **1. Create a New GitHub Project**

First, create a new repository on GitHub. This will serve as the version control for your project and allow Vercel to pull your code directly.

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.

2. Click on the “New repository” button.

3. Name your repository and optionally add a description.

4. Click “Create repository.”

### **2. Clone the Project to Your Local Machine**

Now, clone the GitHub repository you just created to your local machine so you can start working on the project.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:emhat098/vercel-express.git
cd vercel-express
```

### **3. Initialize a Node.js Project**

Next, initialize a new Node.js project using npm init. This will create a package.json file, which is essential for managing dependencies.

```bash
npm init -y
```

The -y flag automatically accepts the default configuration, so you don’t need to go through the interactive prompts.

### **4. Modify the package.json File**

Edit the package.json file to define a start script that Vercel will use to run your application.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```

This tells Vercel to start your application by running node index.js.

### **5. Install the express Package**

Install Express.js, which will be the framework we use for this application.

```bash
npm install express
```

This will add Express to your node_modules and update your package.json file.

### **6. Create a Simple Express.js Application**

Now, create a simple Express.js application. Open the index.js file and add the following code:

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello! I am in vercel.com);
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

This code sets up a basic Express server that responds with “Hello! I am in [vercel.com](http://vercel.com/)” when you visit the root URL.

### **7. Create a New Project in Vercel**

Now that your Express.js application is ready, it’s time to deploy it to Vercel.

1. Go to the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).

2. Click “New Project.”

3. Select “Import Git Repository” and choose the repository you just created on GitHub.

4. Vercel will automatically detect your project and set it up for deployment.

### **8. Deploy the Application**

Once the project is imported, Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application. You can monitor the deployment process in the Vercel dashboard.

### **9. Add vercel.json to Resolve Plain Text Issue**

If your server is showing plain text instead of executing code, add a vercel.json file to configure Vercel properly. This file should be placed in the root of your project.

```bash
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "index.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration ensures that Vercel handles your Express.js application correctly.

### **10. Summary**

In this article, we’ve walked through the process of deploying an Express.js application to Vercel. Starting from creating a GitHub repository, cloning it to your local machine, setting up a Node.js project, writing a basic Express.js server, and finally deploying it to Vercel. With these steps, your Express.js application should be live and accessible via the URL provided by Vercel.
