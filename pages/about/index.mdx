# Self-motivated Software Engineering

Hello and welcome! Iâ€™m a dedicated and self-motivated Software Engineer
with a passion for cutting-edge technologies. Over the past six years,
starting at the age of 18, I have honed my skills through self-directed
learning and professional experience in the industry. My journey has led me to
develop a robust proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js, as
well as PHP and Postgres. Here, I share insights, tutorials, and my
experiences in the ever-evolving world of software development.

### Overview:

- Self-learning software developer since 2018.
- Studied at Cao Thang College.
- First program was based on Google Keep, written in [ASP.Net](http://asp.net/) Core 2, LinQ, MSSQL, Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML.
- First company was Fuijnet System JSC, a Japanese company. The technologies I used included Visual Basic and .NET framework for building a logistics desktop application.
- First freelancer job involved working on a series of American restaurants for automatic cooking using the PERN stack - Postgres, Express, React, and Node.js.
- First global company was Nashtech Global Company, working on the business domain of education for OpenLearn University in the UK.
  - Website application: Developed and maintained the entire system, integrating with hundreds of plugins. The application used the Moodle framework with PHP at the backend and Vanilla JavaScript for building the UI at the front-end. Other technologies used were Postgres, SCSS, HTML, Docker, and AWS cloud services.
  - Mobile application: Maintained the application during core app version upgrades by fixing UI issues in the WebKit element for both Android and iOS. Developed new features by manipulating the DOM tree of the Moodle App. Resolved performance issues for users with many courses. Supported the on-shore team in debugging and fixing issues in the production environment.
- First contract going into production: [Bazango.vn](http://bazango.vn/) is my first application built from scratch for a client in Ho Chi Minh City. It uses cutting-edge technology with Next.js 14, MongoDB (now migrated to Postgres with a third-party service on Vercel), Google Cloud Storage, JWT - Jose (resolving authentication problems in the middleware of Next.js), React.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind, Shadcn, Radix-UI, and Vercel.
